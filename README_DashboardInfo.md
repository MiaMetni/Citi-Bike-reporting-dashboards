CU-VIRT-DATA-PT-12-2023-U-LOLC MODULE 18 ASSIGNMENT Repository


City officials tasked with publicizing and improving the program rely on data-driven insights to make informed decisions and implement strategic initiatives. By examining seasonal ridership patterns, I, as the (theoretical) lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, can provide city officials with valuable insights into the program's overall performance throughout the year, enabling them to optimize resource allocation, tailor promotional efforts, and enhance user engagement during peak and off-peak periods.

Two key phenomena – seasonal variations in ridership and station utilization trends – within the program's utilization data spanning from 2014 to recent year (2024), are addressed by two respective dashboards. 

## Phenomena 1: SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN RIDERSHIP:
understanding how ridership fluctuates across different seasons provides critical insights into the program's overall viability and effectiveness throughout the year. By identifying peak and off-peak periods, city officials can allocate resources more efficiently, optimize bike distribution, and tailor promotional campaigns to encourage usage during slower periods. 

Ideally, this relationship between season and ridership should be observed across all years-having-data-provided given that larger sample sizes increases the confidence of assertions and diminishes unreliable data/misrepresentation of the greater population. HOWEVER, for the purpose of this assignment, I will be observing the relationship between season and ridership within one year (2014) only, comparing the hottest-recorded month (July) and coldest-recorded month (January) that year.

## Phenomena 2: STATION UTILIZATION TRENDS:
Delving into station utilization patterns sheds light on the accessibility and attractiveness of various bike stations across the city. Identifying the most popular stations for starting and ending journeys, as well as the least utilized ones, offers valuable information for optimizing station placement, enhancing accessibility for users, and improving overall program accessibility. Moreover, analyzing changes in station popularity over time allows for the identification of emerging trends, shifts in user behavior, and potential areas for infrastructure improvement or expansion.

### MENTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS:	
#### TIMEFRAME: 2014 to 2023
Given the continuous evolution of the Citi Bike program and the dynamic nature of urban mobility patterns, examining these phenomena over the specified timeframe offers a comprehensive understanding of long-term trends and patterns. By analyzing data spanning from 2014 to the most recent complete year (2023), one might be able to better capture a holistic view of the program's growth trajectory, seasonal variations, and changing user preferences, enabling city officials to make informed decisions regarding program management, infrastructure development, and strategic planning for the future of urban transportation in New York City.

#### SELECTED TIMEFRAME: 
The timeframe selected (2014) was done selected for its data size (smaller than data collected from 2023) and type (includes data that represents trip duration without column manipulation)

The time frame suggested for consideration (2014 to recent, 2023) is meant to offer a holistic view of the program's growth trajectory, seasonal variations, and changing user preferences by comparing data over time HOWEVER, for the purpose of this assignment (to demonstrate mastery of tableau and data visualization comprehension) and the nature of the data ( large), data from years within the range is not included unless explicitly mentioned otherwise. As such, the analysis of ridership data over time is meant to illustrate more a change-in trends rather than an evolution of trends from 2014 to 2023. Also note, the decision to use data from 2023 and 2014 instead of 2024 and 2013 for the end-of-range and beginning-of-range data was intended to reduce inaccurate data as the 2024 and 2013 years are incomplete.

#### DASHBOARD VALUE PROPOSITION (general):
Given the absence of a sophisticated reporting process within the program, our analysis of these phenomena will fill a critical gap by providing city officials with actionable insights to guide program optimization and strategic planning. By leveraging data from 2014 to the present day and applying these processes for consideration to said data, we ensure that our reports have the ability to capture the program's long-term trajectory, enabling city officials to make informed decisions to publicize and improve the Citi Bike program for the benefit of all New York City residents and visitors

## Phenomena 1: SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN RIDERSHIP:
understanding how ridership fluctuates across different seasons provides critical insights into the program's overall viability and effectiveness throughout the year. By identifying peak and off-peak periods, city officials can allocate resources more efficiently, optimize bike distribution, and tailor promotional campaigns to encourage usage during slower periods.

Investigate the following across timeframe (for 2014 vs 2023)
### How does ridership vary between different seasons (e.g., summer vs. winter)?
across different customers
#### subscribers and non subscribers?
#### Men vs women
#### Start time across either season
#### Duration across either season
#### Start station destination (station favorability)
### Are there specific months or time periods within each season where ridership peaks or declines?
### Do patterns differ between short-term customers and annual subscribers in terms of seasonal usage?
### Are there any geographical variations in ridership patterns across the city during different seasons?
### How has the distribution of trip durations changed over time, especially in relation to seasonal fluctuations?

### Which bike stations are the most popular for starting and ending journeys (2014 versus 2023), and what factors might contribute to their popularity?
### Map stations and include marker for popularity (calculated based on rider visits per year) Conversely, which stations are the least popular, and what factors could explain their lower usage?
### How have the popularity rankings of bike stations evolved over time, and are there any notable trends or shifts?
### Are there differences in station popularity between weekdays and weekends, or between peak hours and off-peak hours?
### Can we identify any patterns related to station accessibility, such as proximity to public transportation hubs, tourist attractions, or residential areas?
